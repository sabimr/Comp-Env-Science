Hi!
I'm excited to take this class because I'm not great at 
data/programming  but I want to learn more about it and keep 
strengthening my skills in this  area. I'm taking this course 
specifically because I want to learn how to communicate science 
through models and visual information and this class is a basis 
for that.

My data science background is basically coursework on this area,
more specifically learning the basics of coding and programming 
in R, tidying data sets, plotting, and analyzing results.
